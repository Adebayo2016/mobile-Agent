# simplesql
a library that makes sql command easy

simplesql takes away the burden of creating simple sql querries yourself,
all you need are a few information that query needs; for example table name,
column names, etc.
with simple sql you can read queries from a file (csv,json,txt) or supply the query,
as a string object.
